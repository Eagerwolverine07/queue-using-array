Sure, here's an example README file that explains how to implement a queue using an array in C:

# Queue Implementation using Array in C

This is a simple example of how to implement a queue using an array in C. In this implementation, we use an integer array to store the elements of the queue, and two indices `front` and `rear` to keep track of the front and rear elements of the queue, respectively.

## Queue Operations

We implement three basic queue operations in this implementation:

- `enqueue`: This operation adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- `dequeue`: This operation removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `print`: This operation prints the elements of the queue from front to rear.

## Implementation Details

We use an integer array `queue` of size `MAX_SIZE` to store the elements of the queue. We also use two integer variables `front` and `rear` to keep track of the front and rear elements of the queue, respectively. If the queue is empty, both `front` and `rear` are initialized to `-1`.

The `enqueue` operation adds an element to the rear of the queue by incrementing the `rear` index and adding the element to the `queue` array at the new `rear` index. If the queue is already full, an error message is printed and the element is not added.

The `dequeue` operation removes and returns the element at the front of the queue by incrementing the `front` index and returning the element at the new `front` index. If the queue is empty, an error message is printed and `-1` is returned.

The `print` operation prints the elements of the queue from front to rear by iterating over the `queue` array from the `front` index to the `rear` index.

## Conclusion

In this README file, we explained how to implement a queue using an array in C. We provided an example implementation of the queue operations `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `print`, and showed how to use them in a simple example program. This implementation can be extended and modified to suit your needs.
